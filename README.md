Cheat sheets for Odin project lessons and such.

Hi! My name's David Oikle! I'm learning web development (albiet mostly backend) via The Odin Project.

This repository is my way of keeping track of things i've learned from the Odin Project.

Some of it is hand writtern, some is copy/pasted from the Odin Project's lessons. The goal for me is to go in (rough) order of learning, so that if I step away from a project/type of code (CSS/HTML/JS/Etc) for awhile, I can go through from the "beginer" and skip as far ahead as I need.

If you come across this, feel free to use it! My goal long term is to build a series of web pages to provide examples of how all these different....things work. 
For example, a page that shows bold or italics, different properties to a link or flex box, or whatever else.
