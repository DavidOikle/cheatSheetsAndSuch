* universal selector : Good for things like using the same font for an entire page/project.

ORDER OF Specificity:
ID > Class > type
Failling diferent selector's, the section with a higher number of selectors will take over and overwrite the one with a lower number of selectors.

Type selector.
HTML:<div> Text here </div>

CSS: div {
color: white;
}

Div is just a placeholder here, can be made into anything like "left","account name", or whatever else. 
Very broad, and applies to everything with it.
A better example would be something like <h1>Header</h1>. Having the 

Class selector
HTML:<div class="alert-text"> Elements go here </div>

CSS: .alert-text {
color: white;
}
Similar function to a type selector. Multiple classes can be applied to a single element. class="alert-text severe-alert"

Id selector:
HTML: <div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>

CSS: #title {
  background-color: red;
}

Noted by the #, the ID selector is similar to the class. Big thing is an element can only have one ID, so they are VERY specefic.
Don't over use when a class will do.

Group selectors:

CSS: .read,
.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}

.read {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  /* several unique declarations */
}
Group selectors usesful for cutting down on repetition. All text can have the same font for example, but different sizes and such.

Subsection Header: 
HTM:<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>
CSS:.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}
What .subsection.header does is it selects any element that has both the subsection and header classes. 
Notice how there isn’t any space between the .subsection and .header class selectors. 
This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one type selector.

This can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:
HTML: <div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection" id="preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>

You can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:
CSS:.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}

.subsection#preview {
  color: blue;
}
In general, you can’t chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. 
For example, chaining two type selectors like div and p would give us the selector divp, which wouldn’t work since the selector would try to find a literal <divp> element, which doesn’t exist.

Descendant Combinator

HTML: <div class="ancestor"> <!-- A -->
  <div class="contents"> <!-- B -->
    <div class="contents"> <!-- C -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="contents"></div> <!-- D -->

CSS: .ancestor .contents {
  /* some declarations */
}

For the above, D would not have the CSS stuff applied to it, as it doesnt have the necesary parent of .ancestor, despite having .contents.



COLOR: 
 /* hex example: */
  color: #1100ff;
  /* rgb example: */
  color: rgb(100, 0, 127);
  /* hsl example: */
  color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);
  
  FONT:
  font-family: "Times New Roman", sans-serif;
  
  font-size: 22px
  
  font-weight: bold
  font-weight: 700
  
  text-align: center
  
  (CSS):
  img {
  height: auto;
  width: 500px;
}

background-color: yellow

Inheritance
<div id="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
CSS: 
#parent {
  color: red;
}

.child {
  color: blue;
}
Despite the parent element having a higher specificity with an ID, the child element would have the color: blue style applied since that declaration directly targets it, while color: red from the parent is only inherited.

Rule Order
Baring anything else, the RULE order will decide what wins. 
Really simply, actually. Whichever rule was the last defined is the winner.


External CSS
HTML: <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

INTERNAL CSS (Within the HTML file - try to avoid this unless it's for a single page)
<head>
  <style>
    div {
      color: white;
      background-color: black;
    }

    p {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>...</body>

INLINE CSS ( AVOID UNLESS A ONE OFF, AND EVEN THEN, REALLY ASK IF IT's A ONE OFF)
<body>
  <div style="color: white; background-color: black;">...</div>
</body>
