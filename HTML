<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title goes here</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  
    // Most elements must be contained within the <body></body> to function, other than things like referencing a style sheet, the language, or other settings style items.

</html>



<p> Paragraph - probably the workhore of plain text in HTML </p>
<h1>Header types - goes from 1 -6 </h1>

<strong>Makes text bold</strong>
<b>Makes text bold - DIFFERENT THAN STRONG </b>

Remember that HTML uses parent/child nesting.
  So anything applied to a parent will apply to the childern of said parent aswell.

Unordered lists!
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

And an ordered list! 
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>

<a href="https://www.google.ca">An Anchor element, used to turn a piece of text into a hyperlink.</a>
  Omiting the HREF part makes it not appear as a link, as the HREF gives the text a blue colour by default.
  Also important to remember absolute vs relative links. Absolute, IE: https://www.google.ca, are links on the internet.
  Relative is a local link, IE: about.html, if the about.html was located in the same location as the current address. IE an index going to an about page.
  Add in the folder name and a slash to go to a sub directory. IE: pages/about.html.
  A ./ at the front will indicate a link should be found from the current directory. Good to help avoid future issues.
  In addition, a ../ wil indicate going up a folder. Can be chained as many times as needed. ../../../etc
  Just starting with / will return to the root.
  
Images! Can be linked to using either absolute or relative addresses, same as above.  
<img src="https://www.google.ca.png">

Alt  <img src="image_address" alt="Alt text goes here"> will display alternative text should the image not load, and is also important from an accesibilty stand point, should someone be using a screen reader or something similar.
